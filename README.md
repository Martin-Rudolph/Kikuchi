## 1 Installation instructions
Install a valid version of Matlab 2018b or higher. Download the folder MergeEBSD and run within this folder the script MergeEBSD.m.

## Run the script
Only change parameters in the Input section. Comment the second PatterList images to show the reconstruction of the measured patterns instead of the simulated.
Press the run button.

It is recommended to use as reconstruction type overlayed (cut works not properly) and the others may result in blurry images in case of imperfect data.
